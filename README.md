# ML_project1

## General information 

The repository contains the code for Machine Learning course 2021 (CS-433) project 1 (Higgs Boson challenge: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs) at EPFL. 

### Team members
The project is accomplished by the team `TheVipers` with members:

    * Camille Frayssinhes: @camillefrayssinhes
    * Assia Ouanaya: @assiaoua
    * Theau Vannier: @theauv

With a Test Accuracy of xxxx we got the xxxxx-th place out of 228 teams.

### Data
The data `train.csv` and `test.csv` can be found in https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project1/data, to run the code please download them and place them in a `data` folder.

### Environment
