# ML_project1

## General information 

The repository contains the code for Machine Learning course 2021 (CS-433) project 1 (Higgs Boson challenge: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs) at EPFL. 

### Team members
The project is accomplished by the team `TheVipers` with members:

- Camille Frayssinhes: [@camillefrayssinhes](https://github.com/camillefrayssinhes)
- Assia Ouanaya: [@assiaoua](https://github.com/assiaoua)
- Theau Vannier: [@theauv](https://github.com/theauv)

With a Test Accuracy of xxxx we got the xxxxx-th place out of 228 teams.

### Data
The data `train.csv` and `test.csv` can be found in https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project1/data, to run the code please download them and place them in a `data` folder.

### How to run the code
The project has been developed and test with `python3.8`.
The required library for running the models and training is `numpy1.20.1`.
The library for visualization is `matplotlib3.3.4`.

### How to reproduce the obtained results

The final results used to predict the test datasets for the final leaderbord place on Aicrowd are generated by running:
`run.py`.
And the final results are saved in: `/data/finalsubmission.csv`.
